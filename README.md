# BlacklistBeGone
Enterprise app blacklist remover using SparseRestore.

## Disclaimers
**Version support**

Supports iOS 17.0-17.7 and iOS 18.0-18.1 beta 4.

Newer versions will never be supported (unless another file write exploit drops).

**For content creators**

We understand that clickbaiting with flashy thumbnails and misleading titles is the only way you know how to make your channel grow and the algorithm and blah blah blah.

However, we also don't enjoy dealing with people asking why it's not working on the latest iOS version because they saw your video on their recommended and couldn't say no to a big red arrow.

If you're gonna make content about our work, we can't stop you. But please don't be clickbaity about it. 

## Usage
1. Disable Find My on your device. You can re-enable it when you're done.
2. Install `pymobiledevice3` in your Python environment.
3. Run `unblacklist.py` with your device plugged in.
3. Select option 1 to remove blacklist.
4. Wait a few seconds.
5. Profit. If your device doesn't reboot automatically, reboot it.
